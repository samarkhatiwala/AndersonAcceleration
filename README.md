# AndersonAcceleration
Anderson Acceleration for solving fixed point problems and spin-up of seasonally forced ocean and land biogeochemical models

Note: I'm not currently updating this repository while I restructure the code. Email me for the latest version as well as a python implementation.

This repository contains code for solving fixed point problems using Anderson Acceleration. While it can be used for 
any fixed point problem it was designed to enable use of the code on batch HPC systems for computing equilibrium solutions 
of periodically-forced ocean and land models. It is based on the MATLAB routine AndAcc.m originally written by Homer F. Walker 
(Anderson acceleration: Algorithms and implementations, Worcester Polytechnic Institute Mathematical Sciences Department 
Research Report MS-6-15-50, 10/14/2011) with extensive modifications as per Khatiwala (2022), "Fast spin-up of geochemical 
tracers in ocean circulation and climate models, J. Adv. Model. Earth Sys., https://doi.org/10.1029/2022MS003447.
